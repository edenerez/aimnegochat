      h3 Dear participant, 
      h3  You are about to engage in a deliberation over the question whether to legalize the use of marijuana or not. Once you join the chat environment you'll be coupled with another participant, this might take a few minutes if you are the first player to join.
      h3  During the deliberation phase, which is in a free chat environment, you and the other participant are asked to state your arguments in a clear fashion and refrain from irrelevant arguments. 
      h3  When you feel you exhausted the deliberation with the other participant â€“ please tell him that and exit the chat using the "opt out" button at the left bottom part of the chat page .
      h3  For your participation you'll be awarded 30 cents  +  1 cent for every logical argument you use during the deliberation. 

      h3  Best.
