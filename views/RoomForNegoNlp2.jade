        li The negotiation relates to several <b>issues</b>. For each issue, there are several possible <b>values</b>.
        li Your score depends on the <b>values</b> in the final agreement, and on <b>time</b>. Click "Your scores" for details.
        li You will get a bonus in cents: <b>score/4</b>. 
        li Your score can be higher than 600. An average score is 400, which means 1 dollar bonus.
        li Note that the bonus is much higher than the base payment, so it pays to negotiate longer and get a better agreement! 
        li Use the menus below as a draft. Your partner cannot see them - you communicate with <b>chat</b> only.
